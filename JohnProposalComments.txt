Hey Phoebe

This proposal is really great on the intent, method, and specific museuological rationale for doing this work.  As such, I have read it for what will go to CSTMC.  What is less clear at this stage is:  

1) where will the final project be hosted? 

2)  for whom is this work being done? I know we have always assumed it would be for CSTM, but you do not say this and I think that needs to be clear. Related to this, you also need to mention that you will be writing a reflexive essay that will examine  the process of making this digital exhibit, including identification of best practices for future work.

3) the pedagogical elements that will accompany the 3-D imaging (this should get discussion right after the 3rd paragraph) are missing in this and I think they are really important to the whole project because in addition to making this "thing" you are also making a how-to-use-this-thing guide that will be pitched at...high school age students?  Perhaps undergrads in history and social studies of technology programs?  

When we ask David and Shawn to read the proposal as an academic exercise, you will keep all of this but you need to add a lit discussion and identify the scholarly questions you will pose of the project.  But let's leave that aside for the moment.

As for publishing:  send me the essay.  I am on the editorial board of UHR and I will give it a read wearing that hat.  I can then advise about what to do with it.

p.s. It is super exciting to be finally reading the you that got me all geeky when you applied and we chatted!  This is your stuff.  And it soars.
